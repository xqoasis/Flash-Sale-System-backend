# Flash-Sale-System-backend

- Designed the “Flash Sale System” project. 
- Improving performance from 500 QPS to 10,000 QPS by employing Redis and RocketMQ.

- Functions: commodity; promotion -> order -> pay;
- Adopted DDD(Domain Driving Design): api - application - domain - infrastructure
    - Split order service into promotion and order microservices according to DDD(Domain Driving Design) principles.
- high-concurrency:
    - Implemented cache preheating for active promotions. Completed lock and revert inventory service through Redis and Lua script.
    - Peak-load shifting order service stress by asynchronously create order using RocketMQ. Implemented "Pay-Check&Cancel" by consuming delay message. And optimized optimistic-lock of updating inventory in MySQL database.
- test: Postman; Jmeter
- JIRA (canary mode)


## Version1

1. MySQL lock、Pessimistic Locking、 Optimistic Locking，to prevent oversell
2. Database Event - Transaction， SpringBoot event management
3. PostMan: API-testing tool
4. Jmeter: concurrency testing tool

## Version2

1. Redis + Lua script to achieve event,  Redis cache preheat
2. RocketMQ

    Idempotency, delay message, etc.
    
3. Junit5， Mockito: unit test

## Version3 (WIP)

1. Distrubuted Transaction
2. Redis: distributed lock
3. SnoFlake to generate OrderId
4. Microservice find and register center: Consul，Feign declare， SpringCloud-Gateway
